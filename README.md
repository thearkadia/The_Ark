# The Ark - ¿Democracy's Favorite Device?

The Ark is a portable computer that can be upgraded, modded, or repaired by the user since it uses open-source software, the pcb files are available, and the parts can be purchased individually. It is powered by the [Raspberry Pi Compute Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-plus-lite/), and runs a modified version of Debian.

# Simplifying Democracy
One of the goals of the Ark is to simplify the process of participating in a democracy for citizens, journalists, and politicians in a safe and transparent way. To simplify participating in a Democracy we will develop open source applications that focus on different key aspects of a Democracy. 

(images below are only mockups of the applications. all companies, charities, and names are used for demonstration purposes only) 

* An open source application that allows citizens to keep track of the voting history of their representatives.

# Simplifying Budgets, Boycotts, and Taxes

* An application for journalists and charities to easily recieve reccuring donations from supporters. 

* An application to simplify the process of boycotting companies by displaying what products and companies a conglomerate owns or has a stake in. With a search feature to find alternatives to the product\service they are looking to purchase.
